# ZOK
A repository for the ZOK interpreter

ZOK is a language based off of OK but with new features

Most languages only are able to read one file at a time.
With ZOK, this number has been increased 100%!
A program for ZOK must be put in as two separate OK files.
Once run, the interpreter will read both files and weave
the lines from each file and read the final result of the
two.  The added benefit of this is that for some programs,
you can use the same A or B program and simply change the
other one out.  This can be seen in the Hello World/Alex!
example.
